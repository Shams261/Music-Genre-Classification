### Introduction

- This project aims to classify music genres using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of audio files labeled with different genres and can predict the genre of an unseen audio file. The web application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading audio files and displaying the predicted genre.

### Features

- Audio File Upload: Upload a .wav file for genre prediction.
- Genre Prediction: Predicts the genre of the uploaded audio file using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- Responsive Web Interface: User-friendly and responsive web application built with Bootstrap.
